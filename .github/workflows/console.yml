**Explanation:**

* `name`: Defines the workflow name for better organization.
* `on`: Triggers the workflow using the `schedule` event.
  * `cron`: Uses cron syntax to specify the schedule. In this case, `*/10 * * * *` means every 10 minutes.
* `jobs`: Defines the jobs within the workflow.
  * `console`: The job name.
  * `runs-on`: Specifies the runner environment (here, Ubuntu).
  * `steps`: Defines the individual steps to be executed in the job.
      * Each step is a command or action executed serially.
      * Multi-line commands can be used with the `|` character.

**Important Notes:**

* Make sure you have `console.sh` and `base.md` files in your repository.
* Consider adding error handling and logging for better feedback.
* This workflow pushes changes directly to the remote repository. If you don't intend automatic pushing, modify the last two steps (`git push`).
